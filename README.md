# What is Brelby? In a nutshell, it is: 🍷 🧁 - you're welcome, 🌍!

Responsively designed, based on a SASS tutorial from CodeStackr. This app is lovingly adapted from a [Flatiron School project](https://github.com/miShelbyT/brelby) created with my wonderful friend [Bryn Knowles](https://www.linkedin.com/in/knowlesbryn/). Brelby's lives on!
